# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to map out earthquake locations to be displayed for visual analysis and comparison to other geographical data.

## Analysis

Using leaflet.js, we were able to create a tile layer that was the base for the map. On this layer we added several other layers that displayed:

- Earthquake data over the last 7 days
- Tectonic Plates
- Major Earthquakes (defined as having a magnitude >4.5) that had occured over the last 7 days.

With this information displayed we were able to visualize where earthquakes occur, and their relationship to the tectonic plates.

## Summary

From the data we were able to display we were able to determine a few facotrs. First, most earthquakes occur on or near the borders of the tectonic plates. Second, nearly all major earthquakes occur along those same borders, also known as faultlines. Third, it would seem major earthquakes are more common than the average person would believe. I was initially very surprised that over the last week so many major earth quakes had occured.
